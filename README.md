Hi everyone! My name is Samuelle St-Onge and I am a first year PhD student at Polytechnique Montréal, Canada. Prior to my PhD, I also did a master's in healthcare technology engineering at ÉTS in Montréal, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering at Université de Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. During my PhD, most of my work will be focused on spinal cord imaging for pediatric populations. 

## PROJECT DEFINITION
---
Parkinson’s disease is a neurogenerative disease for which we currently do not have any cure. Finding new biomarkers for Parkinson's could help diagnose the disease at an earlier stage, therefore being able to start treatment early and slow disease progression. 

In recent work, diffusion MRI has shown a potential interest for finding biomarkers in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson, using Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Diffusion Imaging, commonly known as NODDI.  

My project aims to use an existing open-source NODDI toolbox and adapt it to a spinal cord diffusion MRI dataset containing both healthy subjects and subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Then, using the python data analysis tools and skills I have learned during BrainHack School, I will analyze the extracted metrics from the NODDI model fitting to explore potential biomarkers for Parkinson's disease.

### Why NODDI for Parkinson's disease?


### Why spinal cord images for Parkinson's disease biomarkers?
